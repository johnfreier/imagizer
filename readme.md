Imagizer
===============================================================================
This is an attempt to create some sort of image reconstruction porject.  It started off as a way to identify if a JPEG image is a picture of a cat.  I have updated the project to attempt to find the eyes of a cat and place a mustache on the cat.

In the future it might be nice to create this as a service online and let others upload their images and see if the program can identify the eyes and place the mustace in the correct location.

Build
===============================================================================
This project makes use of a Makefile, so it is a pretty standard project to build

```shell
> make

> ./run
```

Dependencies
===============================================================================
## libjpeg
